## Development

```

**2，install**
```
cd **
npm install
```

**3，run app**
```
npm run dev     // development mode
```

**4, build dist**
```
npm run build   // build dist for frontend
```

## Deploy

The project has integrated related suites, such as nginx dockerfile, docker-compose.yml. So you can easy to deploy the project.

* First: I recommend that you debug locally and make changes to configuration information, such as database information and personal information.

* Secondly: you can choice the docker to deploy this project. It is very esay. you only ```pull``` the project to your server and install ```docker```, and run ```docker-compose build``` command, and run ```docker-compose up -d``` command

**However!!!⚠**

If you don't want to use docker, you must to ```cd``` the relative item and run ```npm install or yarn install``` command.

At the same, When finish install, you need to run ```npm run start:prod``` command.

Finally start nginx, before you may need to modify several areas of nginx config.

for example:

```nginx
upstream server {
    server api:8080;
}
upstream blog {
    server blog:3000;
}
upstream admin {
    server admin:3002;
}
upstream music {
    server music:7000;
}

# change the ```api,blog,admin,music``` to localhost or 127.0.0.1
```

## Environment dependence
